# Welcome to Blush!

Accountable is a WebApp that makes it easy to track your goals to lead a more productive life. The app allows users to:
- Create and login to an account with a username and password
- Set long-term goals, with customizable tracking information
- Users can scroll through each week in their journal and see their logs over time, like paging through a journal
- Users can create goals and logs and watch each submission pop up in the appropriate date slot
- After 30 days of tracking, an analytics platform is unlocked for users to track their progress in each goal
- Either a line or bar graph is shown for analytics based on the type of goal (binary vs amount tracking)

This Accountable API is seeded with default data for an existing user.
